# Full Stack Application: RAG Knowledge Base from PDFs

This full-stack application allows users to log in, upload their own PDFs, and create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base. Users can then interact with their knowledge base through a chat interface. The application is built with a **React** frontend, **Vite** for bundling, **Cloudflare** for serverless APIs, and **Python** with **LangChain** and **Llama3** for the backend.
